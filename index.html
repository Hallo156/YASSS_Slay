        <h3><strong>SLAY!</strong> He said, as he got his weapons and burned down the world.</h3>
        With that it was settled. Mr. Squidward was on his way to become the one many wanted him to be.

    <h3><strong>But how?</strong></h3>

    In such a <strong>cruel</strong> world, where there is no tomorrow. One could only think about giving up.
    Mr. Squidward was like no other. He tried himself at many things, and was fully enjoying is life.
    It could have been about <em>painting</em>, <em>drawing</em> or even <em>music</em>.
    Especially his music was considered <em>tremendous</em>.

    <h3><strong>But then it all changed!</strong></h3>

    It was a day like no other, when the first portal opened. It was in Squidward's home, where it opened.
    For a long time, he was considered <em>lost</em>. None, not even his neighbour Spongebob could have known
    where he went.

    Spongebob was totally frightened because of Squidward's sudden disappearance.
    He wouldn't even leave his house anymore. Patric said.

    <h3><strong>But for Squidward this was a chance!</strong></h3>
    He on the other hand was transported into another <strong>dimension</strong>!
    In his few years he was travelling through the dimension, he became more than a squid.
    He learned the way of the blade. With his many tentacles, he was considered the best student
    among his sensei's. Until after three years he became the master himself.

    <h3><strong>But then, another portal!</strong></h3>
    Before he even could take the first steps, of making a name for himself, another portal appeared!
    He thought to himself, that this might be the only chance. He may never encounter another portal ever again.
    So even though he may lose all of his relationships again, he will challenge this luck of his.
    But on the other hand, he felt some excitement to he said. It was this portal too, which changed his life.
    Which gave him a purpose and made him feel appreciated. So he jumped through it to encounter another phenomenon.

    <h3><strong>He was young again!</strong></h3>
    It was a <strong><em>miracle</em></strong>! It was as someone had turned the time back.
    Mr. Squidward wouldn't waste this newly found opportunity, and started to take action. First he checked his
    surroundings. It was clear for him ass day and night, that he again was in an unfamiliar environment.
    It was cold, and the air pressuring. He couldn't even see the sky under the massive trees surrounding him.
    Next he checked for his belongings, which marvelously seemed intact but pretty damaged to. This was the first moment

    too, at which he found himself the first time at confronting local wildlife. It was a giant monster. As big as a
    whale.
    Squidward recalled too, that this monster wasn't chasing after him, but a group of adventurers. With no time to
    waste
    he pulled out his five katanas and sliced the monster in small chunks of meat. The adventurers filled with aw,
    looked up to Mr. Squidward, while he was realising too, that he doesn't know much of this world but saved them
    nonetheless. The adventurers surely asked him to which fraction he belonged, to be at such dangerous place
    to which he replied that it is something none should know. He didn't want his identity to be released to soon
    and even then no one would have believed him either. The adventurers on the other hand, were curious.

    <h3><strong>After a meal follows a new purpose!</strong></h3>
    To show their gratitude, the adventurers wanted to treat their Hero to a meal. Squidward thought of this as an
    opportunity. He who doesn't know anything about this new dimension, would have a chance to be guided by a few
    locals.
    Some time later he found himself in a city like none he had ever seen before. It was in the same age as the last

    dimension, but the style seemed more simple. With many different species as locals living in it, one wouldn't think

    of its small color spectrum. Arrived at the local pub, he was told to eat what he wanted for saving their lives.

    Mr. Squidward being the benevolent hero, he only chose a moderate dish. But after the first bite, he was filled

    with a new feeling he had long forgotten. This feeling he encountered, was the fuel missing for his new adventure.

    After interviewing the cook himself. Squidward was flabbergasted with the skills of the cook and the final result.

    So finally he asked if he could be his student for the next few years. The cook replied , that only if he could

    help him in some way. For Mr. Squidward this was an easy task. He took an ingredient and asked the cook how to slice

    it. The cook replied, and while he did. Squidward threw the ingredient in the air and sliced it in a blink of an

    eye with one of his many katanas.

    <h3><strong>A healthy change.</strong></h3>
    The head chef couldn't believe his eyes. Which was no surprise. Such precise movements, defiling the laws of the
    body
    and still sharp and fast. He could have been considered a top rank adventurer there. But still the cook asked
    himself why? Why would such a person learn to cook? Squidward saw disbelieve in his eyes and answered. <strong><em>Once
    in a
    while,
    a little change of environment is needed... And while being on a long mission, such changes might save a live.</em></strong>

    The cook was in tears, after hearing those words. It wasn't because of the words spoken, but because of the feelings

    emitted. He felt several emotions, drilling into his mind like vivid dreams of sorrow. Shortly after the cook agreed
    and
    gave him his uniform. The first few days were pretty normal. The mornings were silent, evenings loud and the between

    and odd feeling of being watched or stalked by single persons or groups.

    <h3><strong>The way of the cook.</strong></h3>
    Squidward learned many things in his first weeks there. Other than the observation and selling of food,
    which he already knew from his time from the <strong>Krusty Krab</strong>, he learned the different
    techniques of gathering information and cooking food too. It only took him a month to cook something
    worthy selling as a main product in the pub. But his career has only started yet. After another few months,
    the chef came one day and told him, that he would like to talk privately to him. He said to him, he would have
    nothing more to teach him. So he should go to one of his friends. He gave Squidward the direction and a small pouch

    with a letter in it. Squidward was confused first, but later took his things and went on another week long
    adventure.

    <h3><strong>A new chef.</strong></h3>
    On his way, he met many adventurers. Some small and strong, others large and week. He used this time with them
    to gather more information or to try out new dishes. The best reviews are the once on the fly he said. The new chef

    was the same, since he was one of those adventurers travelling with Mr. Squidward. Squidward new something was up

    but couldn't connect the strings up until both of them were standing before his destination. The new chef was harsh

    but truthfully honest. He said. Mr. Squidward had potential to earn the titel of being one of the best cooks. But as

    he is right now, he couldn't even hold a candle against them. So the chef cook gave him a mission. He Mr. Squidward

    himself should travel as the food paladin. Squidward was confused. He didn't know the meaning behind being a
    food paladin. So the cook answered. The food paladin is a holy being with its only purpose to find and cook the

    perfect ingredients. As the food paladin, one could only kill what he would cook and only cook what he would eat.

    The chef also said, that Squidward couldn't come back until he finds the food maker. Who the food maker was,
    wasn't told to Squidward. Only that he would understand if he sees him. With all that said. Squidward accepted.

    He took his new armor and tools and embarked on his cooking journey.

    <h3><strong>Every long journey requires patience.</strong></h3>
    First weeks, then months and at last years went by. But still after all this time. He couldn't find this almighty
    he was talking about. But this wouldn't matter. His will won't break because of something so insignificant like
    time.
    In the end he was the one who accidentally beat time. He used this extra time well. Learning the different ways of
    preparing and cooking food isn't something one just can do overnight. But after exactly three years and 250 days,
    he found something. It was something unreal. Something which should exist. But after travelling through a portal
    twice, even the impossible may come true. In the middle of a field of flowers was a single door. The adventures
    told him, they would just visit a friend. But this friend was not ordinary it seems. Going through the door the
    whole aesthetic changed.

    <h3><strong>A different kitchen!</strong></h3>
    It was modern. More than in Bikini Bottom. But that's not all. There were many different beings resembling animals
    or humans. But the most interesting ones were huge human crabs. The bottom half was a crab and the top a human.
    They seemed like warriors, having a hard shell as an armor. But Mr. Squidward wasn't the only one who was
    interested. As the huge crab like being moved closer, Mr. Squidward felt a heavy aura coming. This aura could
    easily knock out a normal being. But as Squidward stood his ground, his companion said to the crab: "See? I told
    you, he is no joke." But the crab only replied with a grunt and left into the kitchen. The unnamed companion on
    the other hand smiles at Squidward and leads him to a table. He said that the chef likes him. But Mr. Squidward
    wasn't so sure. At least the reaction wasn't something great. But right after that the crab cook came back with
    meals of the most <em>extravagant</em> kind. Those couldn't be compared with anything Squidward had ever seen
    before in his whole life! Not even the Krabby Patty could be compared to it! It was the dish Squidward wouldn't
    know about, but needed the most right now. His companion only said with a laughter: Oh, this is the kind of person
    you are! First Squidward was again confused, but finally he understood the purpose of his journey.

    <h3><strong>It starts with 1.</strong></h3>
    Right after the delicious meal, Mr Squidward instantly went straight to the cook. He must learn how to cook the
    most perfect dish for every person. He couldn't let this life-changing opportunity slip. But as he found the master
    chef. He already knew the crab was waiting for him. He pointed to a gate, leading to a beach. Squidward followed
    and watched him closely, as he pulled out a strange object and screaming in a distorted language
    <strong><em>[*Tools Of The Legendary Cook*]</em></strong>. Right after the object lit up. Energie was flowing
    through
    the whole body of the huge creature, emitting a glorious aura and ordering everyone to kneel down before the
    ultimate
    cook. It was the first time after many years, where Squidward felt week. Not even worthy of being in the near
    presence of such a being. But before Squidward could fall for the ordering aura, the memories and goals of his life
    flew through his mind. Telling him to not give up yet. To stand up and facing his opponent head on. Squidward
    answered to his call, standing up and watching deep in the eyes of the crab. It was the first time for Squidward to
    fully see the shape of the master cook, while not shivering in fear through the emitted pressure.

    <h3><strong>Better than gold!</strong></h3>
    Right after he stood his ground. Tools, which could be considered as holy artifacts, appeared before the chef.
    He took one of them, a spatula, and swung it right before Mr.Squidward. Squidward couldn't even watch his fast
    hand movement. He only could feel the mighty air flowing around him, nearly blowing him of the ground. The crab
    seemed impressed. As Squidward would later know, that he was the first to not being blown away. As with that
    the test was finished. With that the chef accepted Squidward as his student and taught him the importance of
    omniscient. But being omniscient isn't an easy task, which would require many years of training. But first the
    mission, the rest will follow after. Squidward promised to deliver some spices. The chef agreed and gave him the
    spices and another object. It was shaped like a cube but can be considered as a key. It was the emblem of the chef.
    With it one could travel to the dimensional restaurant at any moment of time, and go back to the last position.
    Mr. Squidward instantly knew the importance of this object. It was an object of trust. Lastly the chef told him to
    arrive every day least once in the restaurant, or he won't be considered as his apprentices anymore. It was
    harsh, but Squidward accepted. From this moment on, Squidward had a new master. A strong guardian of the stove!

    <h3><strong>Deja vu...</strong></h3>
    Few months later. Mr. Squidward had already completed his mission, each and every day he would go to the restaurant
    not once but mostly twice. Or even stay there for days. The training was harsh. But it was needed. Since Squidward
    doesn't have any energy, he would need to acquire it first. Energy was the most important drive right now. Without it,
    he wouldn't be able to use the rune. But right after Squidward wanted to gather ingredients in the wild, something
    happened. He wasn't in the town he last slept in. It was something different, something <em>magical</em>... He was
    again in a forest. But much darker than the first one. The pressure was greatly enhanced by the surrounding mana.
    But it was nothing compared to the pressure from the chef. Since Mr. Squidward already wanted to collect more
    ingredients in the first place, he used this chance to explore the unknown and find new spices. Right after some
    hours he found a village in the middle of the forest. It was something much more colorful than the surrounding
    ever darkness. It seemed like the cheerful smile of an innocent child in midst of a post apocalyptic world. But
    right before he could enter some strange people stopped him. Those were heavily armored. Almost looking like the
    guardians of the forest. Without showing any skin at all, Mr. Squidward couldn't know who he is facing right now.

    "HALT!" spoke those two loudly gazing upon the hidden katanas. Mr. Squidward with no intention of fighting, drops
    the most of his katanas but keeps his spatula close by. The two elf's can not believe their eyes, at the moment he
    dropped his many weapons. But they showed consideration for his gesture and asked him to follow them. In the village
    Mr. Squidward saw many people. But only females. He was somewhat confused by this sight, as why he asked for the
    reason about it. The two guardians remained silent and only went forward. After a few minutes have passed. Squidward
    found himself in a waiting chamber. It was pretty cozy with the furniture and a nearly endless supply of fresh
    water. But Squidward couldn't shake of this feeling of something great coming. And as he predicted, the door opened!
    It was a fairly familiar sight. The person entering was just like the previous elf's. But other clothing. It was
    the queen of elf's. But mr. Squidward wasn't curious about her. On the contrary, he didn't even realise her entering
    because of the slowly approaching wall of something  energetic. It wasn't energy, the source of power which
    Mr. Squidward was trying to learn. But Mana. Mana and Energy are two driving forces, but somewhat different on how
    to use them. The one needs a suitable object to unleash a great effect. And the other requires wisdom of
    understanding. But before mr. Squidward could grasp a sight of the unknown person, he heard a soft sound. "Äh am!
    Dear traveler from afar. If you wouldn't mind, could you please enlighten us about your reason to suddenly visit us?"
    Right after, Squidward recognized the queen standing next to him. With utmost sincerity he instantly greeted the
    queen, but couldn't avoid this lingering feeling of curiosity. Which entity might be behind this wall, was one of
    his thoughts. But this question should soon be answered. A few seconds after Squidward started explaining some
    of the details, to which why he is here, without mentioning his current chef or other private maters. The mana
    blessed entity entered the room.

    <h3><strong>The rightful leader.</strong></h3>
    It was a being with a hidden face. But nevertheless, the entity seemed like an elf. But this should not matter,
    since it instantly cut of Squidward's explanation. "So you can cook? Then show us the greatness of the so- called
    Food Paladin!" Squidward confused for a short time, accepts the challenge. But he wouldn't do without a reward.
    Before Mr. Squidward could even state the reward, the being cut him of again. "It shall not matter what you might
    ask now, it will only depend on the mood afterward. Squidward grinning, accepts again. Both instantly leave
    towards the arena, not knowing that the queen was left behind baffled. At the arena. It seemed like a one on one
    showdown, with only him and the entity in such a big place. "With such an empty place, there is no glory to it!
    I will make it easy for you, traveler from afar! With the reward, I will give you the extra chance of proving
    yourself right before the eyes of the whole village!" With that the entity waves it hands towards the shining sun
    and casts a spell of the size of a building. But the size wasn't the only great thing. With every following second,
    a thousand of elf's appeared out of nowhere, including the again baffled queen. Each one of them was
    summoned on a specific seat with the queen on her throne. "I hope you don't have stage fright! Since you will
    performe before all of us! Good luck traveler, I'm expecting much of the food paladin!"

    <h3><strong>Food wars!</strong></h3>
    It was like a war. Squidward knew, that time wasn't his benefactor. He knew that depending on the audiences mood
    the food might taste worse. The most important thing now is, to hype the audience. But this was nothing. the main
    problem on the other hand, was how he would be able to keep the atmosphere on an all-time high until the end of the
    demonstration. If he showed his cards to early, the atmosphere would drop rapidly, but if he waited to long, the
    audience wouldn't even care about the rest. He had something in mind. Something which will satisfy the taste buds
    and leave room to entertain the audience throughout the show. With that he started the show, gathering some of the
    ingredients and slicing them instantly into small bits. The crowd looked interested at the traveler. Right after
    Mr. Squidward switched over to the next part of his strategie. As a multi talented squid, he was able to do multiple
    task at the same time. He wasted no second, and prepared everything. From potatoes to flesh. Once it was done the
    stove came next. With the main dish in the stove, he next prepared a side dish. he threw the fruits and vegetables
    into the air, and slashed them into cubes. Not even one of them touched the ground, but the bowl. They perfectly
    circled with a colorful rhythm. The crowd looked baffled. But this wasn't all. He took some of the spices and mixed
    a sweet and salted sauce, and mixed the salad from bowl, with the sauce on a grill. The smell was amazing, the crowd
    cheered!. While grilling the salad, his last step, was a fruity cocktail to finish the tropical dish. He luckily had
    some skills as a bartender, and could mix and shake with his acrobatic skills. And as he was ready to pur in the
    drink. The main dish in the stove was finished. He took out the main dish, with the sweet salted salad and a fruity
    cocktail, and presets everything in a noble manner to the entity. The entity laughs. "You! Traveler from afar,
    presented a beautiful performance today. Now the last test is, how it tastes." The entity waves her hand, and the
    queen appears next to her with some suitable tools. "Now lets feast!"

    <h3><strong>Another dish well done!</strong></h3>
    As the entity took it's first bite. The whole area seemed in a state of shock. The entity was frozen in place. There
    was no movement for nearly a minute, until a single tear dropped from its cheek. The crowd gasped. It was something
    none of them had ever seen before. Another few seconds in, the entity stood up and starred with it's not visual
    face right into Squidward' eyes. "How? HOW!? What do I need to do, that I will be able to taste such things again?"
    Squidward smirked, and answered, that he wouldn't be able to cook for her until the end of time, but he could
    extend it to some days, weeks or even years. "And what is it, that you strive for?" Squidward answered again, that
    he wanted to be its student. He was traveling for a long time, and wanted to learn many things. And this kind of
    magic, was something he had never seen before. The entity laughed again. "Such an easy request. Alright! From now
    on I will be your teacher, as long as you cook for me!" The crowd cheered again loudly. "Now lets go my student.
    Let's see how fast you can learn." Soon after the entity, Squidward and the meal disappeared. Some months later.
    No one had seen the entity, nor Squidward for a long time. There was an alarm in the village. A huge beast started
    a stampede towards the village. The queen didn't know what to do. There are just to many. For the elfen fighting
    force to succeed, each one of them would have to kill least 100 of them. But those weren't normal animals, but
    beasts. The last chance of surviving this catastrophe would be to hope for the entity. But it was nowhere to be
    found. Until suddenly a bright light appeared. This single light killed over hundreds of beast in a single cast.
    And the caster was no other than Mr. Squidward!

    <h3><strong>The magic Squid.</strong></h3>
    It was majestic. The beasts couldn't do anything, but only dying. It was like a show of light. Each and every beam
    was surrounded by different kinds of colors. Including water blue, bright light, green air and many different
    colors. "You learn pretty fast traveler..." Squidward didn't answer. "Seems like our time together will come
    to an end soon. I'm already missing the food..." Squidward again didn't answer. "After your mission, come to the
    arena. There is still one thing you need to do." With that the entity disappeared. Mr. Squidward already knew what
    is going to happen soon. In the arena, he and the entity are the only one there. But this time, no other people are
    summoned. On the contrary, the entity wraps the whole arena with some sort of beforehand prepared bubble. Mr.
    Squidward takes out his staff, and holds it right front of him. "I see, so you are already prepared..." The entity
    too pulls out a somewhat ancient staff, with a bright core, from its pocket dimension. "Then, shall we begin." The
    entity immediately changes in a more melee style, and forms a scythe at the head of its staff. Squidward was able
    to block its attack, but isn't able to cast anything while being permanently attacked. "Seems like you are in a
    conflicting situation." Squidward knew, about what it was talking, but still needs to wait for a benefiting
    situation. A few seconds in the fight, Squidward formed a magical Katana around his staff, and pushed back it for
    a mere second. But this still was enough for Mr. Squidward to change into a ranged weapon. He pressured it to
    fall back, with his magical shoots. It is a though situation, knowing that one mistake could lead to someone's
    defeat. The entity realised too, that melee won't work anymore, so it switches to a rapid fire of magical swords
    leaving Squidward with no chance other to dodge. Blocking those much will only empty his mana storage. It is a
    fast fight of athletic dodging and casting on both sides. There are even moments, at which it seems like they are
    teleporting, but both know, this would only cause defeat. Teleporting requires too much mana, and can easily be
    found. In a fight between powerful mages, it would only be like walking into your opponents trap. "I see, you
    already know my spells. This means, that I should switch over to my bigger ones." With that the entity summons an
    army of different kinds of golems. There are like a wall of enemies, which covers the main heart. Even though
    Mr. Squidward uses powerful and fast spells. Against hundreds of strong golems, this is nothing. So he will use
    his most powerful spell too. "It is said, that with great power follows great responsibility. Let's see, how
    responsible you can be!" From behind the numerous golems, a bright light glows in the arenas shadow. "Final
    DEZIMETER!" Squidward, knows that it all will be over, if he cannot overturn this attack. But luckily for him. He
    was already prepared. Right at the moment, the beam from the entity hits the center, it disperses. Or more it
    seems like it was sucked in by something. The light around changes rapidly between white and black. "What... What
    did you do?" The beam was now fully eaten, and only a small black hole remains.

    "The matter of being..." Squidward performs some unusually movements, and the black hole answers. "And you can fully
    control it?!" The entity falls down on its knees. "I... Surrender. From now on you will be the new Arch-Priest Merlin."
    The black hole disappears. With the current arch priestess defeated Squidward now fully mastered the magic of this
    dimension, and is now one step closer to be an unkillable being. Even though he still needs to master the techniques
    of his chef master. But time has already stopped flowing for Squidward. But Mr. Squidward wasn't that cold. He
    walked past the entity, and dropped a small key. "What's the purpose of this key?" Squidward told her to use it in
    a private room. It will create a door to an unusual place, he said. "Does that mean, you will leave?" Squidward
    nodded and walked away, leaving the entity and the whole village behind.

    <h3><strong>Back in the shack.</strong></h3>
    Next day, Squidward was back at catering in the dimensional restaurant. The last year he was quite busy with
    learning magic, so he could only attend the training in the restaurant, but not really help out with the customers.
    One could say, that the cook wasn't really happy about it, but he knew Squidward's drive for power well. But what's
    the purpose of gathering more and more power? Isn't he already the strongest? At this moment of time it was only
    about finding a new purpose in life, through learning and using the newly gathered time. But soon he would realise,
    that there are many more difficult beings approaching. But this will be in the future. For now a new guest arrived
    in the restaurant. The entity used the door and instantly recognizes Squidward handing out food to the customers.
    It was perplexed but happy too. She slowly walked through the room, seeing many different species all gathering in
    one place. This restaurant hidden between dimension. As Squidward approached it. The entity hastily asks him if
    this restaurant is his. He quickly shakes his head, and points in the kitchen. Right at this moment, the cook came.
    With his big stature and strong aura, it quickly recognizes his power. "I see... Are there any free tables?"
    Squidward swiftly guides it to a table and resumes his tasks. But as everything seemed normal. The door opened again
    violently.Some screams emitted from the scene. Other guests quickly pulled out their many weapons. But as Squidward
    could reach the scene, it was already over. The cook took care of it. He held something similar to a hellish bug,
    while standing on other three ones.

    <h3><strong>A new enemy.</strong></h3>
    The cook only let out an aggressive grunt, and got back to the kitchen. Every one next to him was shaken in fear,
    and went back to their seat. Squidward on the other hand, wanted to know more and followed into the kitchen. It
    wasn't anything nice. The cook was ranting about those damned bugs. He said, he knew about them since a long time.
    One of his friends should take care about them, but its taking him a bit to long. Squidward understood the problem
    and asked if he could go and look for him. The cook let out another grunt, and took Squidward into his forging room.
    There was a bright spatula on the center table. It was full of cracks. But those cracks aren't something miserable,
    but a proof of good forging skills. But that's not all. There was a rune too. Squidward didn't know what to say. He
    wasn't ready yet to get such thing. But this only proofs how dangerous the mission may be. Squidward accepted the
    gracious gifts and went through the gate, where the bugs came from.

    <h3><strong>In the middle of the hive!</strong></h3>
    It was a big and wide metal door. The sound of bugs ramming their head against the metal, screaming while dying
    through their broken body and masses doing the same. But Squidward asks himself how did those few even came through?
    Until he notices a small hole in the door, filled with eggs and larva. The door was contaminated! Squidward quickly
    pulls out his staff, and casts a poisonous spell through the holes mixed with explosive gas. Right after he creates
    a shield consisting of pressured air before a fire spell follows. The door was strong and sturdy, standing
    passionately against the explosion. The sound of bugs disappeared as well as the function of the door. Leaving
    Squidward with no other choice than to teleport to the other side. The hallway was filled with many different types
    of bug corpses. Even if there had been people. Those bugs would have eaten already. After some time of walking
    through this white underground building. Squidward notices the futuristic technic. But he poorly wasn't really
    interested in such things, as why he cannot comprehend their meanings. On his way up he stumbled upon many
    different hives, and slaughtered all of them. But he realises, the further he goes upwards, the more bugs there are.
    Until he reached the surface. It was a completely destroyed world. Tall but broken down buildings everywhere.
    Burning fire, hoards of bugs and other beasts and two different kinds of gigantic objects in the air. But only one
    of those shows any sign of life. But before he could think about how to get up there, he heard an explosive loud
    sound.

    <h3><strong>A new comrade.</strong></h3>
    The explosion was some kilometers away. But it was close enough to hear, that someone was fighting over there. With
    that said, Squidward was sprinting there. He would first analyze the surrounding, and then decide if help is needed.
    But when he reached the area,he couldn't believe his eyes. There was no person, no enemy. Only corpses. It was as
    someone had decimated a mass of bugs and went on afterward. But who would be capable enough to do such things? Was
    it the friend the cook was talking about? Mr. Squidward needed more infos, and the unknown person has those infos.
    And Mr. Squidward already knew how to get its attention. Later that day, Mr. Squidward was fighting non-stop since
    a few hours. He nearly thought his plan wouldn't succeed. But this soon would change for the better. The
    mysterious person appeared. It was a massive chunk of armor, with all kinds of different for Squidward strange
    weapons. The unknown Person first analyzed the situation, if Squidward was friend of foe. But the huge mass of
    bug corpses, changed his attitude soon.

    <h3><strong>The slayer.</strong></h3>
    The unknown person, jumped down the tall building and cut down a few bugs with his chainsaw. Squidward realized it
    being close by, and changed his fighting style to the one of a true Squidward. It was a massacre. Storms and
    bullet everywhere. It was like a thunder tornado, with four mini-guns and a rocket launcher. None of the bugs could
    have imagined the outcome of this battle. After another hour of intense killing. The bugs stopped coming. On the
    contrary, they fled. Millions of dead bugs where everywhere scattered around the ground. And this was only the
    number of still recognizable corpses. And in the center of them all, where two beings. Standing on top of a mountain
    of many 1 meter big bugs. Both of them watched the other silently, until they moved closer, so they could slice each
    other. But nothing like that happened. Only a handshake, such a thing which one would share with their closest
    friend after a life apart. They did not need words. A handshake was enough to fully understand the other person. The
    slayer went back to the spaceship, and Squidward followed him. It was full of high-tech tools, weapons and
    machines. But there was more. Even though it was minor, he saw some object, which represented some of the Rune-Tech
    which he already knows from the cook.

    <h3><strong>A new training.</strong></h3>
    The slayer opened an elevator door. It went down quite for a long time. Longer, than one would think the station is
    big enough. But once there the slayer showed him the arsenal and a training grounds with many different kinds of
    enemies Squidward had has never seen before. The slayer gave an example, and Squidward followed. It was quite a
    sight. Those none rune nor magic weapons, could wield such destruction. Even though Squidward wasn't in company of
    the slayer the whole time, it was enough to understand the principles of those weapons. Mastering them would be
    Squidward's mission nonetheless. After some days had passed. The slayer left another object. Something which could
    be plugged in the ear. Squidward was a bit confused first, but after he used it, he heard a voice. "Hello, I'm VEGA.
    Pleasure to meet you." The talk went on for quite some time. It was the best way for Squidward to gather more and
    more information. But this training session would soon again find its end. They had found a new major nest. But this
    time it mostly is defended by a guardian being. Alone it would mostly be tough, but this was the past. Now in the
    present, such problems cease from existence.

    <h3><strong>The first pillar.</strong></h3>
    Back on the planet Squidward realized, that no normal bugs are approaching. He wondered if the last fight was the
    reason for this. But it wouldn't matter. As long as the major nests are destroyed, those bugs would not be able to
    reproduce anymore. But the closer the both of them get to the nest. The more the pressure rises. An earthquake
    after another follows, but the source is still unknown. After another hour of silent walking, the nest entrance
    is in sight, but still no bugs approaching. The nest was strange too. Even though the bugs might run away, they
    surely would gather somewhere. But there were nothing, not even corpses. Both were sceptical, if this was some kind
    of trap, but even if it was, they still would need to find the heart of the nest. Nearly in the center of the nest,
    a huge fleshy door was located. As the two of them tried to open it, the rumbling happened. It was as the whole
    ground was breaking apart. From everywhere spikes started coming out of the ground. But those spikes didn't stop
    moving. They seemed to be connected to a huge worm. This 20 meter thick worm started wriggling around the whole room
    with no intention of baking down. It was clear that this surely was the spoken guardian. The slayer was instantly
    prepared to fight. Nothing would miss his ammunition. Squidward doing the same, gets out his staff and the guns.
    Melee would only be the last solution. But strangely, the worm seemed to be nearly immune against both of it.
    Squidward would have to get out the big guns. He asked the slayer, to earn some time, for him to be able to cast
    his spell. The slayer only nodded, and rushed at the worm. After the spell cast was finished, a black hole appeared
    behind the worm, slowly but surly sucking it in. The worm was furious and instantly rushed onto Squidward. Squidward
    who was still maintaining his spell, couldn't doge this gigantic mouth of a worm and was eaten alive. The slayer
    wasn't taking that lightly. He took out all of his arsenal at once, and attacked without holding back anymore.
    Meanwhile, in the worm, Squidward only saw black. He felt a somewhat juice slowly burning through his armor. It was
    now or nothing, as he pulled out his many Katanas, and started slashing against the thick wall of flesh surrounding
    him. He would want to die like this, being sucked in a black hole, while in the stomach of a huge worm. But the
    time was limited. The compressed body of the worm kept approaching, as well as the acid, which is burning through
    his armor. After many slashes, the first beam of light appeared. The shell was strong but once it has no more
    connection to the flesh it will start falling of, as it did. Right before the black hole would have sucked him in.
    Squidward escaped. The body of the worm was too short to take revenge on Squidward. That's why it could only wait
    until it was fully sucked up in the never ending black hole. In moments like this, Squidward mostly asks himself,
    how the other side of the black hole would look like. Was it really deadly? Is living in it possible? But those
    questions aren't easy to answer, yet.

    <h3><strong>New equipment.</strong></h3>
    With the first major nest destroyed. Only some other three remained. But Squidward's armor was destroyed, and the
    slayers one was badly damaged. Both of them returned to the ship. As the topic came up Squidward and VEGA had a
    brilliant idea. It had been a long time since, the slayer and the cook had contact. Even though the cook was no
    master in fighting as the other warriors of his kind. But he still was a rune smith. If they are able to
    combine the strengths of runes and high-tech equipment. The weapons would be world destroying. Plus it was time for
    Squidward to get a new weapon anyway. A weapon, which would put every one of his ability's to use. And with that he
    opened the portal to the dimensional restaurant, and walked in with the slayer. The customers were all in fear and
    awe. The most recognized Squidward, but something about him felt different. And the person waling beside him. Only
    left them in trembling fear. It was as something, like an instinct told them to not mess with them, or it would be
    fatal. The cook instantly recognized the familiar presences. He first only looked down on both on them with crossed
    arms. As Squidward was explaining the situation, the cook started going into his locked up storage. Even Squidward
    didn't know the items inside. It was a cabin filled with some test runes and a special material called Souelium.
    It was a nearly indestructible material, with some special properties. For example the compatibility with runes, the
    bonding with the user and the ability of splintering. The cook said, that he would be able to create weapon and
    armor with it. But the effizient usage would require energy, the same as to control runes, and extreme multitasking.
    Squidward agreed, and ensured him to be able to master everything. The slayer nodded too. The cook was still unsure
    but complies. Another few weeks later. The sets were ready. For Squidward and the slayer. a whole set of armor, with
    the color scheme from before. For the slayer more different specialized weapons, to ensure a similar handling in
    combat as with the ones before. As for Mr. Squidward, a set of multi funktional weapons, using mana and energy.
    Each and every on of them was able to transform between katana and ranged blasters. But this would require the
    mastering of splintering. Luckily the cook has already trained Squidward with the usage of runes and energy.
    Splintering, would have been the next step in the trainings process anyway. With that it was settled. Both Squidward
    and the slayer started training with their newly found equipment. Even though the slayer did not have any energie
    at all, the armor still had great durability. The weapons as well. And with the extra energy cylinder, the fire
    output was least twice as strong. As for Squidward. it took him some weeks to reach the stage of splintering amateur
    but this was enough to use it in combat. With that it was settled, the last fights shall begin!

    <h3><strong>The Squid of Squidas.</strong></h3>
    The other nest were cleared pretty fast. Even though there were guardians. Thous had no chance of even harming those
    two. But as the last nest was destroyed. Something big happened. A huge portal opened in the sky. It is as if a
    great being was trying to stop the full elimination of the bugs. Something massive was descending. One could think
    of it as a greater being, leading an army to conquer the world. Something similar to a demon king. Millions of
    flying monsters, with every imaginable shape stepped through the portal. This too was the first time Squidward could
    hear the slayer say something. "Rip and tear." Squidward answered with a "Sure" and so the last fight began. It
    was indescribable. Everywhere different kinds of colors and falling corpses. Explosions of the mass of atomic bombs.
    Demons of the sizes of a skyscraper fell after another. But the leader of those demons still didn't move a step. Was
    this a fight of time? But as the leader didn't do anything, Squidward and the slayer, didn't use all their cards
    too. They were already prepared to fight them all, and are only waiting for his army to finally perish. And as they
    had predicted. The king, or god of demons started moving. With its huge living sword, it plunged down and created
    a kilometer deep crack into the ground. This was the last battle. Squidward thought.If this strange god like entity
    is dead. all will be over. Squidward and the slayer instantly engaged in combat. One could forget to follow this
    fight with the sole naked eye. The only thing one could easily see, is the impact on the surrounding. Mountains
    in the far distant are cut down. The ground was only a mass of cracks with many pieces flying through the skies.
    But even though, those two killed the whole army, the fight wasn't looking good. Killing millions of demons, drains
    even the best warrior. After another hour of fighting. The surrounding was only a single huge hole in the ground.
    The demon god, as well as Squidward and the slayer, are all at the verge of dying. Full of wounds and broken bones.
    The armor is the only thing holding them together. In a fight, where every wrong move could  mean anyone's death.
    Squidward slipped. The god entity immediately notices it and wants to finish him. But before he could reach him.
    Squidward found himself in flying in the sky of another world.

    <h3><strong>Father Squid?</strong></h3>
    But he wasn't alone. There was someone, right before him in a suit. As Squidward, looked at his own body, he too
    was wearing one. He walked to the being sitting front of him in a business styled room. The being turned around in
    its chair. The face had many tentacles and was the same as his own only with a different color. It was like it was
    directly speaking into Squidward's mind. "My child... I see you are in a desperate situation. You surly have many
    questions. But for now, let me tell you that I can help you out." Squidward only responded with a why. "Well, lets
    say it will be a benefit for both of us. Since there is only one simple thing I want from you to do." Squidward
    answered what he wanted. "As you surely have seen. This worlds population was completely destroyed. The only thing
    I want from you, a person which can travel through dimensions, is to spread my wisdom." Squidward was unsure. And
    first wanted to ask more questions. "Well you can decline. I won't harm you because of that. But the same won't
    apply to the being fighting you right now.""You could consider it as the role of an apostle. But I will give you
    full freedom. As long as you try to spread my wisdom, you can do what you want.""Let's say. The more follower I get
    the more life force I earn. Even though I am a great entity from the swamps of Khhaa'yngnaiih. I am still limited.
    It doesn't matter how powerful one becomes. There is always one with more power. It is true, that a single follower
    does not matter, but many follower from all different dimensions! So what do you think? Do we have a deal?"
    Squidward was deep in thought. Going through everything it said.  And in the end agreed. "Then lets celebrate with
    a handshake! After that I will transport you back and help out with this object." With that it hands over an orb
    and gives Squidward the other hand. "Destroy it as soon as you can, then my power will reach you. But nevertheless
    good luck with the rest!"

    <h3><strong>End of the Road.</strong></h3>
    Back at the fight with the god demon, Squidward was awake again, right before the demon could attack him. He
    instantly crushed the orb, and unleashed an enormous power. Many different tentacles were summoned and wrangled
    around the god. Leaving it no room to move. Squidward screamed now to attack the god. The slayer instantly knew
    what to do. With their strongest ability's and weapons. Many flying shard controlled by Squidward, as well as magic.
    Many different blasters and bullets from the slayer. Everything. Not holding back for a single bit. The god
    couldn't dodge earlier until it freed itself from the tentacles, but it still was too late. He lost over half of its
    body. All of his arms and legs. It was only lying on the ground, not able to move anymore. It could only see, the
    two standing on top of him, with a triumphing face. Again, the slayer said. "Rip and..." And Squidward finished with
    Tear and a shot from both of them through the head of the god. Right after all the corpses start to disappear.
    Squidward starts to turn around a bit and sees a strange looking book on the ground. The book had a big face as
    cover. Once he opened it, a letter was in sight. "To my newly appointed apostel, here is my emblem and some of my
    wisdom. Through the emblem in the back of the book, you are able tho directly send me a message. I hope for your
    future succeed. P.S Hope you like your apostle name Squidwar." Next Squidward looked at the emblem. It was somewhat
    strange to look at. But there was written Squidwar on it.

    <h3><strong>After the End.</strong></h3>
    Back in the restaurant. The fight was over, so the restaurant had a new cashier. The slayer should guard the cash.
    Even though Squidward was unsure if anybody would even try to steal anything from the cook. But better safe than
    sorry. Plus with him at the cash desk, the customers would mostly leave a bigger tip. Could be because they are
    scared, but it wouldn't matter to Squidward nor the cook. The being which are visiting this restaurant would stop
    coming only because of someone scary at the cash desk. But this was for the better, since Mr. Squidward still had a
    mission to complete. So he often handed out a free copied page of the book to the customers, as a somewhat event.
    One could think of it like collecting all the pages or trading them with friends to complete it all! It was as
    simple as effective. Many customers, would soon ask for such a page before he even handed them out. And there would
    soon be an extra room for gambling purposes for those who want to go further than only trading them.

    <h3><strong>Credits</strong></h3>
    And that's it folks! This was the private story, from the interview with the mighty Squidward and how he became
    such a powerful worker of the cook. And if one is lucky enough to stumble upon this dimensional restaurant, maybe
    one will be able to find him there!
